# Survivor-Winner-Modeling

Currently working on getting the data into a good tabular format to be able to run modeling.

## Goal

I am curious to see if there are any early game or pregame attributes of Survivor players that make them more likely to win. 

## Data

There is a great package in R called SurvivoR that has over 15 different datasets! Shoutout to GitHub user @doehm for providing this library.

## Methods

I am leaning towards using XGBoost and other Tree based models, but need to learn more about the data before I can truly decide which ML models best fit this data.
